What? I didn't touch a guitar! No, but you're questioning my method! No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe. I'm saying it's stupid! What? Thank you. You know, none of my other student thought I was stupid. Your other student was you! Yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little harder. Maybe I need to try a real teacher. Right here, here. Andy Cooper. He teaches guitar. And look, oh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid. Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar! Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor. But don't come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired of hearing you play bad, bad Leroy Brown. Baddest man in the whole damn town. Fine! Take his side!
